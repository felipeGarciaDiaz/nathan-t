                    <p>Aviation and aircraft design has always been something that fascinates me. Challenging myself, I
                        decided to take on this project without ever being formally taught in aerodynamics, aviation, or
                        aircraft design! See how my thought process behind deciding on an a type of aircraft, designing
                        the aircraft, optimizing for best flight characteristics, and building/testing the prototype! I
                        intend to use software such as MATLAB, SolidWorks, and XFLR5 to help me optimize and execute the
                        best design

                <p>
                    Given that I had little prior knowledge of how flight aerodynamics and aviation actually works and
                    the general
                    equations involved in flight, I decided to do some research and dive deep into some textbooks and
                    radio-controlled plane resources (More
                    specifically, <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Aircraft-Design-Conceptual-Daniel-Raymer/dp/1600869114"
                        target="_blank">Daniel P Raymer's "Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach"</a> and <a
                        href="https://www.flitetest.com/" target="_blank">FliteTest</a>). These resources helped me
                    self learn the fundamental knowledge required to
                    draft reasonable designs!

                    Before diving straight into material selection and desigining my flying wing, I decided to draft a
                    full list of criteria ranging from flying speed and time to general flying style. Here is a
                    shortened table representing the most important criterias.

                <p>I started by calculating the Wing Cubed Loading for my design. The wing cubed loading is
                    expressed as:
                    \[WCL = {w \over SA^{(3/2)}}\]
                    where \(WCL\) is the wing cubed loading, \(w\) is the weight, and \(SA\) is the wing surface area.
                    Ensuring that my \(WCL\) was less than 4 was crucial since I wanted to build a slow flying wing. You
                    cans ee how I got weight estimates in the <a href="javascript: scrollToC();">next section</a>.

                <p>
                    In addition to the structural design and specifications, I also had to select a series of
                    electronics in order to power my RC flying wing. These electronics include LiPo batteries, an
                    Electronic Speed Controller (ESC), a brushless DC Motor, Servo Motors, a transmitter, and a
                    receiver. During this stage, I challenged myself to learn more about each of the components in terms
                    of storage, usage, and compatibility to ensure safety. Some examples of this include, ensuring the
                    ESC has a higher
                    amperage rating and built in BEC to avoid fire, checking the LiPo for safe connectors and safe
                    discharge rate, and learning about LiPo charging safety.

                    Beyond compatibility and safety, ensuring the motor produced enough thrust for a reasonable thrust
                    to weight ratio was essential to ensure flight. The 2200KV motor shown above was able to generate
                    a 450 gram thrust on a 2C battery ensuring for a close to 1:1 (thrust:weight) ratio allowing for
                    ease of flight. With a motor draw of 21.5A on average, I decided to go with a 30A ESC allowing for a
                    higher amp rating of about 40% more, keeping the components nice and cool during flight.

                    I created a spread sheet of
                    the weight of the components and additional parts that might be an addition to the overall weight.
                    For safety measures, an additional 50 grams was added in calculations.
