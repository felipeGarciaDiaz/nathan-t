                    <p>Aviation and aircraft design has always been something that fascinates me. Challenging myself, I
                        decided to take on this project without ever being formally taught in aerodynamics, aviation, or
                        aircraft design! See how my thought process behind deciding on an a type of aircraft, designing
                        the aircraft, optimizing for best flight characteristics, and building/testing the prototype! I
                        intend to use software such as MATLAB, SolidWorks, and XFLR5 to help me optimize and execute the
                        best design

                <p>
                    Given that I had little prior knowledge of how flight aerodynamics and aviation actually works and
                    the general
                    equations involved in flight, I decided to do some research and dive deep into some textbooks and
                    radio-controlled plane resources (More
                    specifically, <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Aircraft-Design-Conceptual-Daniel-Raymer/dp/1600869114"
                        target="_blank">Daniel P Raymer's "Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach"</a> and <a
                        href="https://www.flitetest.com/" target="_blank">FliteTest</a>). These resources helped me
                    self learn the fundamental knowledge required to
                    draft reasonable designs!

                    Before diving straight into material selection and desigining my flying wing, I decided to draft a
                    full list of criteria ranging from flying speed and time to general flying style. Here is a
                    shortened table representing the most important criterias.

                <p>
                    In addition to the structural design and specifications, I also had to select a series of
                    electronics in order to power my RC flying wing. These electronics include LiPo batteries, an
                    Electronic Speed Controller (ESC), a brushless DC Motor, Servo Motors, a transmitter, and a
                    receiver. During this stage, I challenged myself to learn more about each of the components in terms
                    of storage, usage, and compatibility to ensure safety. Some examples of this include, ensuring the
                    ESC has a higher
                    amperage rating and built in BEC to avoid fire, checking the LiPo for safe connectors and safe
                    discharge rate, and learning about LiPo charging safety.

                <p class="caption"><i>Electronics used in radio-controlled flying wing. Shown are a 5000mah 80C 2S LiPo

                    Beyond compatibility and safety, ensuring the motor produced enough thrust for a reasonable thrust
                    to weight ratio was essential to ensure flight. The 2200KV motor shown above was able to generate
                    a 650 gram thrust on a 2C battery ensuring for a ratio greater 1:1 (thrust:weight) allowing for
                    ease of flight. With a motor draw of 15A on average, I decided to go with a 30A ESC allowing for a
                    higher amp rating of about 100% more, keeping the components nice and cool during flight. In order
                    to
                    meet the desired flight time, I picked a battery that could withstand the motor draw for a
                    reasonable flight time. Using the following equation below with my 2200mah battery, I was able to
                    get a flight
                    time of about 7 minutes (perfect for a beginner RC aircraft) using only 80% discharge for LiPo
                    battery health safety.

                    \[Flight Time = {{\text{Battery Capacity } (Ah) \over \text{Motor Amp Draw } (A)}*{48 min \over
                    h}}\]

                    I then decided to look into feasible materials that would be easily accessible and easily formable.
                    After doing some lengthy research, I found that many radio-controlled aircrafts use foam board to
                    build the structure of the aircraft since it was so lightweight and robust. As well, repairing and
                    replacing components in the case of damage (since it will be my first time flying something of this
                    sort) is easy and favorable.

                    I created a spreadsheet of
                    the weight of the components and additional parts that might be an addition to the overall weight.
                    An additional 150 grams was added in calculations as a weight estimate to account for small parts
                    such as push rods, hinges, and the general lightweight structure. You can see my weight estimate
                    below.

                <hr>
                <p>I started by calculating the Wing Cubed Loading for my design. The wing cubed loading is
                    expressed as:
                    \[WCL = {w \over SA^{(3/2)}}\]
                    where \(WCL\) is the wing cubed loading, \(w\) is the weight, and \(SA\) is the wing surface area.
                    The wing cubed loading specifies the general flying characteristics of a plane, comparing weight and
                    surface area, where a lower \(WCL\) means slower flying.
                    Ensuring that my \(WCL\) was about 4 was crucial since I wanted to build a slow flying wing. You
                    can see how I got weight estimates in the <a href="javascript: scrollToC();">previous section</a>.
                    Keeping this in mind, I solved for the surface area required to maintain a WCL of 4, which came to
                    be \({0.25m^2}\). I used this to then determine combinations of span and chord. You can see a sketch
                    of a successful combination below.

                <p>After deciding general dimensions, I went ahead to pick an airfoil. Taking into consideration that I
                    was going to use foamboard, it was crucial for me to pick the most optimal airfoil that can be
                    formed using a knife and foam board. This led me to narrow down my search to two airfoils; the
                    Clark-Y airfoil and the N-10. Unfortunately, both are flat bottomed for ease of airfoil formability
                    but are
                    not ideal for flight trimming to ensure straight flight, but there were no other better options.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using XFLR5 I did an aerodynamics analyis of both airfoils to better determine their flight
                    characteristics and make an informed decision for my airfoil of use. Using the following equation
                    (specific to aircraft flight)
                    for Reynold's Number,
                    I inputted a constant Reynold's Number (236878, as experienced at the cruise speed) to avoid
                    overcomplicating
                    calculations for my airfoil analysis.

                    \[Re = {pvC \over {μ}}\]

                    where \(p\) is the density of air, \(v\) is the travelling (cruise) speed, \(C\) is the mean chord
                    length, and \(μ\) is the dynamic viscosity of air. The following results were produced for analysis.
