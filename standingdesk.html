                    <h1>Manual Standing Desk</h1>
                    <p>The last year or so has been a hard hit on everyone due to COVID-19. From adapting to online
                        school
                        to working remotely, we have significantly increased our time spent sitting at a desk which can
                        result in detrimental health problems down the road. As a result, I partnered with Yanshen Zhou
                        and
                        Jaylon Laidlaw in one of my engineering design courses (ME101) to prototype a manual standing
                        desk
                        which can combat this issue. Sit and stand at your own will with ease by simply elevating the
                        height
                        of the desk.</p>

                <p>
                    Before I could fully grasp a concept design, I conducted research on current market
                    standing desks and answered vital questions required to make a successful prototype. Some vital
                    questions included "Who are the targetted users?" and "How can a standing desk be made better and
                    more efficient than current market standing desks?". Moving on from a more general take on the
                    problem, we decided to draft concept designs based on a Needs Analysis.

                    As shown above, A table of Functional, Non-functional, and Constraint Requirements were made to
                    narrow our scope and help us establish feasible concept design solutions. Using a Decision Matrix,
                    we
                    were able to narrow ourselves to one design based on criteria such as performance, safety,
                    feasibility of schedule,
                    cost, environmental impact, ease of use, and aesthetics.

                    In the sections below, I'll walk you through some of the key points in developing, testing,
                    verifying, and prototyping our manual standing desk.

                    For our vertical lift mechanism, we decided to go with a variation of a screw jack, involving the
                    use of a lead screw, worm gear, and worm screw. This mechanism was selected since it proved to be
                    relatively more safe, quiet, and efficient (due to the absence of an electric or pressurized system)
                    based on research. By taking advantage of gear ratios and reducing the torque allwoed to operate the
                    lift mechanism, users can easily adjust the height of their desk.
