                    <p>The last year or so has been a hard hit on everyone due to COVID-19. From adapting to online
                        school
                        to working remotely, we have significantly increased our time spent sitting at a desk which can
                        result in detrimental health problems down the road. As a result, I partnered with Yanshen Zhou
                        and
                        Jaylon Laidlaw in one of my engineering design courses (ME101) to prototype a manual standing
                        desk
                        which can combat this issue. Sit and stand at your own will with ease by simply elevating the
                        height
                        of the desk.</p>

                <p>
                    Before I could fully grasp a concept design, I conducted research on current market
                    standing desks and answered vital questions required to make a successful prototype. Some vital
                    questions included "Who are the targetted users?" and "How can a standing desk be made better and
                    more efficient than current market standing desks?". Moving on from a more general take on the
                    problem, we decided to draft concept designs based on a Needs Analysis.

                    As shown above, A table of Functional, Non-functional, and Constraint Requirements were made to
                    narrow our scope and help us establish feasible concept design solutions. Using a Decision Matrix,
                    we
                    were able to narrow ourselves to one design based on criteria such as performance, safety,
                    feasibility of schedule,
                    cost, environmental impact, ease of use, and aesthetics.

                    In the sections below, I'll walk you through some of the key points in developing, testing,
                    verifying, and prototyping our manual standing desk.

                    In order to determine our general dimensions before modelling a prototype using SolidWorks, I
                    consulted anthropometric data to decide on common body part measurements to determine the most
                    ideal dimensions which would cater to most of the population. With our user in mind, we looked at
                    the top 97th eprcentile in terms of standing and sitting height, as well as common table top
                    dimensions.

                    For our vertical lift mechanism, we decided to go with a variation of a screw jack, involving the
                    use of a lead screw, worm gear, and worm screw. This mechanism was selected since it proved to be
                    relatively more safe, quiet, and efficient (due to the absence of an electric or pressurized system)
                    based on research. By taking advantage of gear ratios and reducing the torque required to operate
                    the lift mechanism, users can easily adjust the height of their desk.

                    teloscopic tubes, we are able to constrain the movement and range of the leadscrew as well as encase
                    the lead screw for safety concerns. Other notable mechanisms included are ball bearings to stop the
                    tabletop from rotating along with the leadscrew and locks on the polyurethane wheels for safety
                    reasons.

                    For different components of our standing desk, we selected materials based on desirable traits and
                    criteria that would optimize the prototype. Below are a few of the criteria we considered for some
                    of the components. We used GRANTA EduPack 2020 software and their database to retrieve numerical
                    values for
                    microstructural properties.
